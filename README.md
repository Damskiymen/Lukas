Lukas - Search Query Handler
============================

Lukas is a library that helps in implementing a custom search query language. 
It offers some standard features users have come to expect from text driven search
like boolean operators and subexpressions.

Lukas can also help you implement custom behaviour for certain keywords, you 
might for eg. define that keyword "photo" to mean "search for things that have a
photo".
